### Abstract
The Tech Institute faces significant challenges with its outdated and poorly planned IT infrastructure, which includes Cisco 2500 series routers, Cisco 2600 series switches, and legacy 3COM HUBs. User complaints about slow network performance hinder productivity. This project aims to overhaul the network infrastructure to improve connectivity, implement VoIP systems, and ensure scalability.
