# Abstract

The Tech Institute faces significant challenges with its outdated and poorly planned IT infrastructure, which includes Cisco 2500 series routers, Cisco 2600 series switches running older IOS versions, and legacy 3COM HUBs for Ethernet connectivity in classrooms. Each campus operates with separate ISP agreements, catering to a diverse student body across four campuses: A, B, C, and D. These campuses host various schools and departments, totaling 7450 students along with support staff, instructors, and managers. User complaints about slow network performance, particularly slow logins, downloads, and database queries, highlight critical issues that hinder productivity and user satisfaction.

To address these challenges, the institute aims to overhaul its network infrastructure comprehensively. Business requirements mandate making all campuses WiFi and printer friendly, ensuring seamless connectivity and printing access from any station to any printer. Additionally, plans include implementing Voice over IP (VoIP) systems for enhanced communication. Technically, the redesign will adopt a structured approach using Core, Distribution, and Access layers, accommodating a projected 20% annual growth in bandwidth demand. Server hardware upgrades are planned to improve performance and fault tolerance, while security measures like Internet firewalls and robust uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) will safeguard critical infrastructure. Furthermore, secure remote login capabilities will be provided for 400 mobile staff members. Budget constraints of CDN $38,000 per academic year necessitate prioritization, with additional wishlist items such as high availability architectures and advanced asset management software contingent upon available funds. The project is set to be meticulously planned and executed with clear timelines and milestones, aiming to improve service delivery and infrastructure resilience across all campuses.
